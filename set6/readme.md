Throughout this week, my learning journey encompassed a comprehensive refinement of Python exercises spanning Set1 to Set5. This involved a meticulous review of concepts, code optimization, and fine-tuning algorithms for enhanced efficiency. Concurrently,I continue to collect the data needed for the data project, sourcing and curating pertinent information crucial for meaningful analysis. The iterative process of refining exercises and gathering data has not only bolstered my coding prowess but also equipped me with valuable skills in data curation and preparation.

In the past week, I dedicated my efforts to an exciting exploration of Python programming with a specific focus on map data production. This endeavor involved delving into geospatial libraries, such as GeoPandas and Folium, to manipulate and visualize geographical data effectively. I immersed myself in concepts like spatial analysis, coordinate transformations, and data visualization techniques tailored for map creation. As I continue my learning journey, I anticipate honing my proficiency in geospatial programming.
